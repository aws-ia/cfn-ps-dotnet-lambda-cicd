This guide covers the information you need to deploy the {partner-product-name} Partner Solution in the AWS Cloud.

This Partner Solution builds a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for serverless .NET applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. It deploys an AWS CodeCommit repository with a sample AWS Lambda application defined in an AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM) template. Pushing changes to modify the application invokes AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline builds and deploys the application using AWS CloudFormation and exposes it to the internet with Amazon API Gateway.
