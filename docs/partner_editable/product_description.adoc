This Quick Start builds a continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for serverless .NET applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. It deploys an AWS CodeCommit repository with a sample AWS Lambda application defined in an https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/[AWS Serverless Application Model (AWS SAM)] template. Pushing changes to modify the application invokes AWS CodePipeline. The pipeline builds and deploys the application using AWS CloudFormation and exposes it to the internet with Amazon API Gateway.
