As shown in <<architecture1>>, the Quick Start sets up the following:

* CodePipeline to create a pipeline with source, build, and deploy stages. The pipeline is invoked when a developer commits a code change to the CodeCommit repository. 
** A CodeCommit repository to host the application source code.
** AWS CodeBuild to generate an AWS CloudFormation template from the source code.
** AWS CodeDeploy to deploy the template.
* CloudFormation to provision and configure the AWS Lambda application.
* An AWS Lambda function to run the code.
* API Gateway endpoint to expose the application to the internet.
* An Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket to store pipeline artifacts.
* AWS Identification and Access Management (IAM) for IAM roles used by CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CloudFormation.
